LME4.R will run the unconstrained solution for the dataset. 

The run.sh file is the shell script that will kick off the run in background on a linux server. Please make sure to properly change the working directory and the executable python PATH. Please do run the codes on a server since local laptop might not have the enough computing power to finish the runs in a reasonable amount of time. 

The computing environment I used are as follows.

Amazon Linux 
Intel Xeon Platinum 8259CL 32 CPUs
Python version: 3.5.3
numpy version: 1.16.4
scipy version: 1.3.0
pandas version: 0.20.1
R version: 4.0.1
